# Description
This is a simple template repository that shows how to interface with a smart contract via TypeScript when you have an ABI to work with.  It generates TypeScript classes for your contracts and then uses those to interact with the contract via a simple little node script.

# Usage
```
npm install
npx ts-node ./source/generate-contract-interface.ts
npx ts-node ./source/index.ts
```
